# Product Mission

## Problem

Developers struggle to master Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) for FAANG interviews. Traditional practice platforms focus on memorization rather than true understanding, leading to poor retention and interview anxiety. Without personalized guidance and intelligent feedback, developers waste time on inefficient study approaches.

## Target Users

Software engineers preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies (FAANG: Facebook/Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, and similar). This includes:

- Mid-level to senior engineers targeting promotions or job transitions
- Junior engineers preparing for their first FAANG interviews
- Engineers returning to the job market after a career break
- Developers who need to refresh their DSA skills

## Solution

Algoholic is an AI-powered DSA training platform that combines multiple unique approaches:

1. **AI-Powered Personalized Learning**: Uses LLM (Ollama) for intelligent assessment, contextual hints, and adaptive difficulty adjustment based on individual performance patterns

2. **Anti-Memorization System**: Goes beyond rote practice with deep comprehension questions that test true understanding. Detects memorization patterns and adapts to ensure genuine mastery

3. **Advanced Technology Stack**: Combines graph database (Apache AGE), vector search (ChromaDB), and LLM to provide intelligent, context-aware recommendations and learning paths

4. **Spaced Repetition for Long-Term Retention**: Scientific scheduling algorithm ensures concepts are reviewed at optimal intervals for maximum retention, preventing the "cramming and forgetting" cycle

5. **Comprehensive Progress Tracking**: Detailed analytics on strengths, weaknesses, study patterns, and improvement trajectories to keep learners motivated and focused

Unlike traditional platforms that simply present problems, Algoholic acts as an intelligent tutor that understands your learning patterns, identifies knowledge gaps, and guides you through a personalized journey to DSA mastery.
