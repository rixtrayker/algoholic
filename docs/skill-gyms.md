# Algoholic — Skill Gyms
## Gamified Cognitive Training for Problem-Solving

---

## Concept

Targeted "skill gyms" that train specific cognitive abilities through questions designed to create "aha moments" and build subconscious pattern recognition. Each gym isolates one skill to avoid overwhelm.

## The Gyms

### 🧠 Gym 1: Pattern Recognition Lab

**Trains:** Spotting patterns, trends, and recurring elements.

**Question types:**
- Visual/numeric sequence patterns ("What comes next?")
- Data anomaly spotting (find the outlier in a graph)
- Code pattern recognition (spot the bug pattern)
- Behavioral patterns (app crashes every Friday at 3pm — why?)

**Progression:** Simple arithmetic → multi-variable → hidden patterns → real-world scenarios → abstract conceptual patterns.

---

### 🎯 Gym 2: Root Cause Arena

**Trains:** Digging beneath symptoms to find true causes.

**Question types:**
- "5 Whys" chains — select correct "why" at each level
- Symptom vs Cause sorting — classify 10 statements
- Cause tree building — construct and identify most likely root
- Red herring detection — identify which clues are distractions

**Progression:** Single-step cause → two-level chains → multiple contributing causes → hidden causes with red herrings → system-level causes.

---

### 🔀 Gym 3: Assumption Breaker

**Trains:** Identifying and challenging hidden assumptions.

**Question types:**
- Hidden assumption hunt ("You're trying to fit a table through a door. What's the assumption?")
- "Must this be true?" — examine each claim in a problem statement
- Alternative perspective — "What would a child/alien assume?"
- Constraint removal — "If you could remove ONE constraint, which changes everything?"

**Progression:** Obvious assumptions → cultural → logical → meta-assumptions → philosophical.

---

### ⚡ Gym 4: Decision Speed Track

**Trains:** Making faster decisions without sacrificing quality.

**Question types:**
- Timed trade-offs (10 seconds: fix the bug OR document the workaround?)
- 80/20 identification (pick 2 of 10 tasks for 80% of results)
- Decision trees under pressure (countdown timer, emergency scenarios)
- "Good enough" recognition (identify where the threshold is)

**Progression:** 30s decisions → 15s → 10s → 5s → 3s with incomplete information.

---

### 🧩 Gym 5: Decomposition Dojo

**Trains:** Breaking complex problems into manageable pieces.

**Question types:**
- Problem chunking ("Break 'Build a social network' into 5 chunks")
- Dependency mapping (arrange sub-tasks in correct order)
- Granularity judgment (is this task too big, too small, or right-sized?)
- Missing piece detection (spot what's missing from a breakdown)

**Progression:** 3 obvious pieces → 5 with dependencies → multi-level → spot incomplete breakdowns → ambiguous boundaries.

---

### 🔍 Gym 6: Information Gathering Ground

**Trains:** Asking the right questions and gathering relevant data.

**Question types:**
- Question prioritization (rank top 3 most important questions to ask)
- Question type matching (open-ended vs closed-ended for this scenario?)
- Information vs noise (mark 5 most relevant facts out of 20)
- Blind spot detection ("What haven't we asked about yet?")

**Progression:** Obviously relevant → good vs great questions → questions that expose assumptions → meta-questions → Socratic chains.

---

### 💡 Gym 7: Solution Generation Studio

**Trains:** Generating multiple solution options quickly.

**Question types:**
- Quantity challenge ("Generate 5 ways to solve this in 60 seconds")
- Opposite solution ("How would you make this WORSE?" then reverse)
- Cross-domain inspiration ("How would a chef/architect solve this?")
- Constraint variation ("Solve with: unlimited budget / 1 hour / no computer")

**Progression:** 3 obvious → 5 including 1 creative → 10 with constraints → different categories → breakthrough solutions.

---

### ⚖️ Gym 8: Trade-off Balancer

**Trains:** Evaluating solutions by weighing pros and cons.

**Question types:**
- Pro/con analysis with weighted criteria
- "Which matters more?" forced ranking
- Hidden cost identification
- Long-term vs short-term trade-off scenarios

---

## Integration with Main Platform

Skill gym performance feeds into the main weakness detection system. Struggling in Pattern Recognition Lab → recommend more pattern recognition questions in training plans. Strong in Decomposition Dojo → reduce decomposition-focused questions, allocate time elsewhere.
